It is based on the lunar calendar, falling on the second new moon after the winter solstice. This means that the date of Chinese New Year varies each year, typically occurring between January 21 and February 20. The exact date is determined by the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar, which follows a 12-year cycle with each year represented by an animal from the Chinese zodiac. As a result, the festival\u2019s date in Malaysia, as well as in other countries that celebrate Chinese New Year, shifts from year to year. This variability adds to the excitement and anticipation surrounding the festival, as communities come together to welcome the arrival of the new year with vibrant celebrations, cultural traditions, and symbolic rituals.",

That first festival hosted over 240,000 people over four days and nights, but in 2023, Untold welcomed a whopping 420,000 punters and 250 artists. Each year, the event is based around a new story that combines mythology and fantasy to create an immersive experience, while headline names in 2023 included Martin Garrix, David Guetta, ZHU, Amelie Lens, and Armin van Buuren (the latter is an Untold regular known for his unique performances at the festival; in the past that\u2019s meant epic extended sets, and last year he brought 300 fans on stage). Outside of the music, Untold celebrates Romanian culture through food and crafts, operates various campaigns such as encouraging blood donation and rewarding high-achieving students with free tickets, and last year implemented a new eco-friendly main stage powered by renewable energy. 2024\u2019s edition will include a new Fashion Village to support Romanian designers, and will welcome superstars like Swedish House Mafia, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Alok, Purple Disco Machine, Black Coffee and Sam Smith.",

This Buddhist custom has evolved into a family reunion holiday during which people return to ancestral family places and visit and clean their ancestors' graves when the spirits of ancestors are supposed to revisit the household altars. It has been celebrated in Japan for more than 500 years and traditionally includes a dance, known as Bon Odori. The festival of Obon lasts for three days; however, its starting date varies within different regions of Japan. When the lunar calendar was changed to the Gregorian calendar at the beginning of the Meiji era, the localities in Japan responded differently, which resulted in three different times of Obon. Traditionally, Obon was celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar.",

Though festivals happen throughout Mongolia, the most iconic celebrations can be found in the northern Mongolian village of Khatgal on Lake Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l. Though the crowds here are small compared to some of the celebrations in Mongolia\u2019s larger cities, the more intimate country-fair vibe of Khatgal\u2019s festival makes it easier to get close to the games and immerse yourself in authentic Mongolian culture. One of the major highlights is the horse race, which can cover as much as 30km (19 miles); it's considered to be good luck to catch some of the dust from the winning horse as it is led away after the race. The wrestling matches during the festival are another impressive sight, with athletes in colorful uniforms engaged in strenuous tests of skill. Each match concludes with a fanciful eagle dance that shows off the athlete\u2019s grace and strength.",

The Carnival season typically lasts for several weeks, with festivities culminating in a grand finale on the last day before the Christian observance of Lent. However, the exact timing of the celebrations varies from island to island. The tradition was brought to the region by European colonial powers, but later reclaimed by the communities transported to these islands as slaves. In Trinidad & Tobago, Carnival season kicks off in February, with events and parties taking place throughout the month. The main parade \u2013 known as \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth\u201d \u2013 takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. In Jamaica, Carnival is celebrated in April and is known as \u201cBacchanal Jamaica,\u201d while in The Bahamas, festivities kick off in late April or early May. On other islands such as Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada and St Lucia, Carnival is celebrated in July or August. Be sure to sample the local rum (every island has its own version) and try some of the special Carnival foods, such as \u201coil down\u201d (a salted meat, vegetable and coconut stew) in Grenada, pelau (spiced rice with peas and coconut milk) in Trinidad and Tobago, and fried escovitch fish in Jamaica.",

        "Description":"Nyepi, also known as the Day of Silence, is a unique Balinese Hindu festival celebrated annually in Bali, Indonesia. Unlike most festivals filled with festivities and gatherings, Nyepi is a day of complete silence, meditation, and self-reflection, marking the Balinese New Year according to the Saka calendar. On this sacred day, the entire island comes to a standstill\u2014no travel, work, entertainment, or even lights\u2014as locals observe strict restrictions on noise and activity. Even Bali\u2019s airport shuts down for 24 hours, and streets remain eerily empty, creating an atmosphere of profound tranquility. Leading up to Nyepi, the island comes alive with Ogoh-Ogoh parades, where giant demonic effigies are carried through the streets in a dramatic procession before being burned to symbolize the cleansing of evil spirits. Following Nyepi, the day of Ngembak Geni marks a return to normal activities, with families and communities seeking forgiveness and renewing relationships.",
